E-maxx pdf-ize
==========

This is an experimental project that aims at generating a pdf version of https://cp-algorithms.com with `pandoc`. This **PDF generator** project may or may not be maintained in the future and is only for experimental purpose.

The generator script is placed under `./pdf_gen_script_generator` and generates a batch file for Windows in `out-sequence` generator. It can be very easily modified for Linux. The script requires:

* Python (only tested on 3.8, other versions should work)
* Pandoc (only tested on 2.13)
* LaTeX (only tested on `pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020/W32TeX)`)
